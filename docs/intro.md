# Introduction

This project is required to prove to the recruitment team of @[Exalens](https://www.exalens.com) regarding the efficacy of knowledge and the development of this Full Stack Project.

This project serves the purpose of mocking the behaviour of different sensors in a typical IoT environment and the devices, with monitoring and logging the climate.Let us consider an apartment like the one below.

Typically we have a the basic structure of a small apartment with

* One bedroom
* One washroom
* A kitchen & dining area
* A living space

Here we are targetting that we have a temperature and a corresponding humidity sensor measureing the respective climate in each of the living spaces in the apartment, a climate control system in short.

In IoT (Internet of Things) terms, "climate control" refers to the monitoring and management of environmental conditions, particularly temperature, humidity, and sometimes other factors like air quality, within a specific space or area. Climate control systems are used to create and maintain specific environmental conditions for various purposes, such as comfort, safety, energy efficiency, and the preservation of sensitive equipment or products.

Key aspects of climate control in IoT include:

1. **Temperature Control:** IoT devices and sensors are used to measure the temperature within a controlled environment. These sensors can transmit real-time temperature data to a central system or cloud-based platform for monitoring and control. Based on this data, climate control systems can adjust heating, cooling, or ventilation to maintain a desired temperature range.

2. **Humidity Control:** In addition to temperature, humidity levels are crucial for certain applications. IoT sensors can monitor humidity levels, and climate control systems can adjust humidity by controlling humidifiers or dehumidifiers as needed.

3. **Energy Efficiency:** IoT-based climate control systems can optimize energy usage by adjusting heating, cooling, and ventilation systems based on real-time data. This helps reduce energy consumption and costs while maintaining comfort or environmental requirements.

4. **Remote Monitoring and Control:** IoT enables remote monitoring and control of climate control systems. Users can access and control the system through web interfaces or mobile apps, allowing them to make adjustments and receive alerts or notifications when conditions deviate from desired levels.

5. **Data Analysis:** IoT platforms can collect and analyze historical climate data to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict future environmental conditions and optimize control strategies.

6. **Applications:** Climate control in IoT has various applications, including:
   * **Smart Homes:** Thermostats and HVAC systems that can be controlled remotely for energy savings and comfort.
   * **Industrial Environments:** Maintaining specific environmental conditions in manufacturing facilities, storage areas, or cleanrooms.
   * **Agriculture:** Controlling climate conditions in greenhouses to optimize plant growth.
   * **Healthcare:** Monitoring and controlling temperature and humidity in healthcare facilities, laboratories, and pharmaceutical storage areas.
   * **Data Centers:** Ensuring temperature and humidity levels are within acceptable ranges to prevent equipment overheating.

Overall, climate control in IoT involves using sensors, data collection, and automated control systems to create and maintain specific environmental conditions, providing benefits such as comfort, energy savings, and environmental stability across various domains and industries.

With these points established we setout to develop on this project.
